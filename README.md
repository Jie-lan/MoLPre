# MoLPre
A machine learning model to predict metastasis of cT1 solid lung cancer and the webapp can be accessed at https://molpre.cqmu.edu.cn/.

Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer-related mortality world-wide with 1.8 million cases in 2022, even so with significant treatment advancements. Due to the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), an increasing number of small-size solid lung cancer are being detected. A pulmonary nodule is a frequent and often incidental finding, and still represents a diagnostic challenge for radiologists. Although most solitary nodules are related to benign disease, some represent stage I lung cancers.

MoLPre's datasets collected from pulmonary nodule and lung cancer database of First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical university, and all patient information were enrolling ranging from 2018.11 to 2022.10.

MolPre was trained on specific patient data, may not generalize to different demographics or unconsidered factors. See [link to article] for training data demographics. It's an auxiliary tool, not for formal diagnosis. Results require cautious interpretation with clinical judgement!!!
